# Jamescape ReactJS Questions

## Amazing work so far!
These questions are to help you showcase yourself and aren't trying to catch you out. By getting to this stage you're doing very well and so you shouldn't feel nervous. There questions aren't designed to take too long so an hour or two should be plenty.

## Everything you need to know
### Project structure
This is just a basic react project with typescript and a router setup. Each question is found in the pages folder. The router is setup such that each question can be found under the url (if hosting localy) http://localhost:3000/one/ , http://localhost:3000/two/, ... etc.

This project uses yarn. To get started just run ``yarn`` and then ``yarn start``


### Where are the questions?
Each question is located on it's corresponding page. There is no difference between the ts and js questions

### Multiple answers?
If you have another way to answer a question and want us to see it please just create a new page file with _1 append to the end. Keep incrementing that number if you have more than 2 solutions. Again we only expect 1 answer so don't feel like this is required.npm

### Comments
There's no need to leave comments although if you think it'll help explain some of your reasoning please go ahead.

### CSS
Don't worry about looks. There will be a bit of css required but inline styling will do for these questions. If you want to separate them out I won't mind

### Libraries
Feel free to import any libraries you want. I'm interested in your approaches and if you think there's a library that'll do the job better please go ahead and import it.

### What if I can't answer a question?
Don't worry, please just leave a few comments with your thoughts and what you tried doing. I'm more interested in your approach rather than if it works or not.

### Is this representative of your current projects?
I wanted to create these questions to simulate situations and problems you'll probably face in our project. However the current frameworks and setup are different. If you're curious, we use a combination of Nextjs, tailwindcss + headless ui, Redux + Thunk, as well as a whole host of others. We don't expect you to have knowledge in these as we can teach you on the job.
